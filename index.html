    <h1>Hey, I'm a Builder at Heart</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a full-stack developer driven by curiosity and creativity. I build tools that solve problems — whether that means scraping job market data, engineering AI-driven workflows, or designing interfaces that just make sense.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      My main tech stack includes Python (Flask), JavaScript (React/Next.js, Node.js), and I specialize in intelligent automation and full-stack development.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔍 Built a Job Market Intelligence Dashboard that scrapes and visualizes job data across regions.</li>
      <li>💬 Developed a Chatbot that turns raw e-commerce data into answers using RAG and LangChain.</li>
      <li>🧠 Created a Chrome extension that fills out job applications and generates custom proposals using AI.</li>
      <li>🎙️ Made a YouTube Transcriber with Flask and AI speech recognition for content creators.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>
      I thrive on learning and iteration. I'm drawn to challenges where tech meets real-world needs — especially when I get to mix logic, data, and a bit of design thinking. I like to work on products that respect users’ time, reduce repetition, and amplify human capability.
    </p>

    <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I’m probably exploring maps, testing out new productivity workflows, or diving into longform interviews and documentaries. I enjoy tinkering with ideas, questioning how systems work, and reading up on design, psychology, and history.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm the kind of person who’ll build a tool just to shave five seconds off a repeated task — and then turn it into a full project if it’s useful for others.
    </p>

    <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you’re looking to collaborate, need a sharp toolmaker on your team, or just want to talk shop — I’d love to hear from you.
